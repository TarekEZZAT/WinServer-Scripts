How do I enable DNS round robin resolution?



A. Recent Windows NT service packs introduced LocalNetPriority which tries to return Host resources that are local to the requestor instead of using round robin however round robin can be enabled as follows:

    Start the registry editor (regedit.exe)
    Move to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters
    From the Edit menu select New - DWORD Value
    Enter a name of LocalNetPriority and press Enter
    Double click the new value and set to 0 to disable LocalNetPriority and re-enable round robin. Click OK
    Close the registry editor
    Stop and restart the DNS service
